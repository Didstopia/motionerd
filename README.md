A continuous motion detection system written in GoLang.

**NOTE: _Work in progress._**

## Todo

- [ ] Implement a basic, image-based motion detection system ([link](https://remy.io/blog/how-ive-created-an-intruder-detector-part-2/))
- [ ] Continuously write a video file to the filesystem in chunks
- [Â ] Detect motion in real-time, while writing the video file
- [ ] Create a new video file that contains the detected motion, -5/+5 seconds, as well as accounts for a cooldown/offset, in case there's continuous motion going on, but also times out after an X amount of time, so the motion triggers as soon as possible
- [ ] Send email or Pushover notifications with images and/or videos attached of each detected motion "clip", being careful to have a cooldown period for each motion, so it doesn't get out of control and spammy
